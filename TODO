rethink the login business since probably there should be more control about the validity time and the username / password not stored to the browser
 -> logout thing
 
*** add logout in many places, add link to the autologin noVnc, help page?
*** landing page (uncertain location)
*** keep somehow track of versions and make available on landing page

** make it so that the password has to be changed
** master script to run all (with optionalPHD2 argument) -- 

* first use script -> set location etc. (also get relevant astrometry files)

how about sequence managing per html??? pyindi?

graphcis blub

* desktop settings see astroberry

reload save stuff from old

nicer organized, clean up, keep repos so that update build can be done?

add other licenses




** in some way a cmake for astropanel & gpspanel would be nice -- maybe put relevant files in subdirs and then see the astroberry-wui cmake
