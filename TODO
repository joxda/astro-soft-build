 
*** help page?
*** landing page
*** keep somehow track of versions and make available on landing page
*** virtualsky stuff

** make it so that the password has to be changed
** master script to run all (with optionalPHD2 argument) -- 

* first use script -> set location etc. (also get relevant astrometry files) -> create ssl certificate

how about sequence managing per html??? 

graphcis blub

* desktop settings see astroberry

reload save stuff from old

nicer organized, clean up, keep repos so that update build can be done?

add other licenses


** in some way a cmake for astropanel & gpspanel would be nice -- maybe put relevant files in subdirs and then see the astroberry-wui cmake


*** ufw? allow ssh and desktop only from local network? indi-server at 7624

check pyclient only listens to 127.0.0.1 !! check it is installed!?
in webclient.py -> self.app.listen(self.port)
add address="127.0.0.1")

astrometry files in astroberry...?!?
/home/astroberry/.local/share/kstars/astrometry
